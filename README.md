# 🧠 CrewAI + Ollama SLM Setup (Bootcamp Edition)

This notebook sets up a local AI agent workflow using:
- ✅ **Ollama** to serve lightweight language models like `phi3`, `tinyllama`, `deepseek`, and `gemma`
- 🤖 **CrewAI** for building multi-agent systems powered by self-hosted LLMs

It includes:
1. Installation and environment setup (Colab-friendly)
2. Pulling and serving small models locally
3. Verifying the Ollama server
4. Integrating models into CrewAI agents

📍 Use this during **Day 1 & 2** of the AI Agents Bootcamp to explore and build lightweight, open-source agent systems.
