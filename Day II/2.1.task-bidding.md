# 📝 Day 2 Exercise Sheet: Multi-Agent Bidding with CrewAI

## 🎯 Goal

Build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) using **CrewAI** and implement **dynamic task allocation** through bidding.  
You will define multiple agents, give them roles, and use a local LLM (DeepSeek) to select the best agent for each task.

---

## 🧪 What You’ll Learn

- How to define multiple agents with different skills and models
- How to create tasks and assign them dynamically
- How to use a language model for reasoning-based task assignment
- How to run and debug a CrewAI workflow

---

## 📋 Instructions

### 1. Define 3–4 agents
Use the `agent_specs` format from the notebook and customize:
- `role`: e.g. Planner, Coder, Reviewer
- `goal`: what they’re best at
- `llm`: assign different DeepSeek models

---

### 2. Add at least 5 tasks
Each task should have:
- `description`
- `type`: to help match to agent role
- `complexity`: use values from 1 to 5

---

### 3. Implement task allocation logic
Use the provided `choose_best_agent()` function:
- Build a prompt that lists agent goals and task info
- Send the prompt to the local Ollama API
- Return the best-suited agent

---

### 4. Create `Task()` objects
For each task, assign it to the selected agent and log the assignment.

---

### 5. Launch your Crew
- Use `Crew()` to create the team
- Set the process to `Process.sequential` (or try `parallel`)
- Run `kickoff()` and capture results

---

### 6. Visualize the result
- Print output in Markdown format (use `IPython.display`)
- Optionally: log task-agent matches for later reuse

---

### 💡 Optional Challenges

- Add a fallback if the model response is invalid
- Use complexity in your agent selection logic
- Try simulating bidding with scoring logic (not just prompt-based)

---

## ✅ Submission Checklist

- [ ] You defined multiple agents with varied roles
- [ ] You assigned each task dynamically using the LLM
- [ ] You ran the CrewAI execution and captured results
- [ ] You displayed results clearly
- [ ] (Optional) You added logs or visual aids

---

## 🧠 Tip

This task mirrors real-world coordination problems: different agents with different skills competing to contribute where they’re most effective. Bidding or delegation is a key feature in advanced MAS systems.
