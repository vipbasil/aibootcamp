# 🧠 Day II — Multi-Agent Systems & Bidding  
**AI Agents Bootcamp 2025**  
📍 UTM — Chișinău • 📅 24 June 2025

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

On Day 2, we move from single-agent tasks to collaborative and competitive **multi-agent systems (MAS)**.

You will:
- Define multiple AI agents with unique roles and goals
- Implement **dynamic task allocation** using CrewAI and Ollama
- Simulate coordination via **bidding, reasoning, or role-matching**
- Apply MAS logic to both technical and small business workflows

## 🧪 How It Works

This MAS system is built using:

- **CrewAI** — Agent coordination framework
- **Ollama** — Local LLM server (e.g. DeepSeek, Phi3, TinyLLaMA)
- **Task bidding** — Agents choose or are chosen based on prompt responses

Use the LLM to ask:  
> "Which agent is best for this task?"  

Then pass the response to a CrewAI task object, and let the team execute.

## 📋 Example Use Cases

- 🤖 Software: Planner, Coder, Reviewer
- 🛍️ Small Business: SalesBot, Bookkeeper, Product Support
- 📊 Finance: Cost analyzer, Invoice checker, Anomaly detector

---

## ✅ Checklist Before Running

- [ ] Install Ollama and pull models (`phi3:mini`, `deepseek-r1:7b`, etc.)
- [ ] Start Ollama locally (`ollama serve`)
- [ ] Run the notebook from top to bottom
- [ ] Review agent assignments in the console/log
- [ ] Try alternate models or task prompts!

## 🧠 Coming Next

**Day 3** dives into advanced tools, agent memory, and performance optimization. You’ll learn about:
- RAG pipelines for agents
- Tool execution (e.g., search, browser)
- Long-term memory in CrewAI

📅 See you tomorrow!
